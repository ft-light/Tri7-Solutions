1. 2
  - base on the diagram, the figures in the even cells make
  a parallel lines on the figure in the middle cell, and the
  figures in the odd cells make a perpendicular lines.

2. 3
  - from left to right of each row of the diagram, the figures
  is increasing in size but not the shape.

3. 3
  - the third column of the diagram is the union/combination
  of the first 2 without changing of position.

4. 4
  - I looked at it as separate columns, the line is not moving (constant),
  the circle is moving from top to bottom with changing of color every
  movement, and the square is moving to its top to bottom while skipping its
  orginal position with changing of color every movement.

5. 3
  - base on the first 2 rows, the black circle is going up and
  the square is going right without changing the color of the shapes
